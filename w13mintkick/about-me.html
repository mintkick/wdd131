              My name is [REDACTED], but online I go by a few different handles.
              On here, you can call me MintKick!

            <p>
              My ideas are ambitious, and as a perfectionist, I have a high
              standard of quality. I learn music theory and techniques and
              strive to keep myself in practice, developing both my composition
              and improvisation while honing my creative skill. With 16+ years
              of musicianship, I have a lot of compositional works under my
              belt.

              Growing up with four brothers and two sisters above me in a house
              full of jokes and laughs, I have acquired experience, by osmosis,
              in skit writing, acting, editing, and production. I come at my
              video making with a comedic perspective, and like to present
              scenarios with humorous twists.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have always had an insatiable desire and love to create,
              develop, and improve projects, either for art or entertainment.
              This is where I want to show you my stuff!

          <h4>The Beginnings</h4>
          <p>
            Initially, when I was very young, I would play around and record
            music on our Roland midi keyboard. I loved playing with all the
            instruments and sounds it could make, but I doubt I sounded good at
            the time, hehe. My brother showed me how it used floppy disks to
            save recordings! No doubt I’ve spent years of my life on that thing,
            and we still own it! After that, I started composing little ditties
            in FL studio, a digital audio workstation that my brother uses.

          <h4>Progress</h4>
          <p>
            Admittedly, the software was too complex for me at the time, and my
            stuff still wasn’t very impressive. Since then, I got into trackers,
            which is a type of music software based on the
            format/structure/method of retro game consoles. My new playgrounds
            were DefleMask and FamiTracker. I started focusing on chiptune
            styles and techniques imitating the sound of classic Nintendo games.
            Learning from my limitations, I have always kept that discipline of
            using a few instruments, or voices, to focus on the
            simple/basic/foundation of good melodies, to fill out a song using
            limiting constraints. (I return to FamiTracker occasionally when I
            want to make a more hardware-accurate/faithful 8-bit song.) I wanted
            to get my hands on orchestral sounds however, so I began writing in
            Anvil Studio, a really old midi editor. It was quite difficult for
            me to use, so I still kept my eyes out for something I could really
            be comfortable with.

            I come from a comedic family. My siblings used to make home videos
            and silly skits, dressing up in costumes and wigs and everything. To
            my admitted disappointment, by the time I came into the picture,
            they had mostly stopped making them. I had always wanted to be in
            their videos or make my own—I would practically beg at times. Over
            the years, I grew both in stature and in humor. Slowly but surely, I
            began to hone my comedic ability out of its childish sense.
          </p>
          <h4>Progress</h4>
          <p>
            Owning an iPod Touch changed everything. I now had a camera. When I
            was able to convince them, I made videos with my brothers; when I
            wasn’t able to convince them, I made my own. I’m kidding—when we had
            good ideas and were able to riff off each other, that is when a skit
            was made out of it. Once I had friends, a phone, and a car, I could
            collaborate with people outside my siblings to write scripts and
            content. The scripts, however, rarely saw the light of day. The
            skits that get made are the ones that are spur of the moment—when
            something funny is happening or being talked about and someone
            decides to film a video out of it. In fact, that is what most (but
            not all) of the videos on my channel are right now: the ones that
            had the least amount of planning.
